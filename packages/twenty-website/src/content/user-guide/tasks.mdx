Easily manage all tasks within your workspace using the **Tasks** feature. This guide will show you how to create and manage tasks, switch between upcoming and completed tasks, edit task details, and much more.

# Creating Tasks

Creating tasks in Twenty is seamless. You can either:

-  Go to the `Tasks`tab and press the `+` button at the top right of the page.
-  Use the search function by pressing `cmd/ctrl + k`, then select 'Create task' from the list of quick actions.
-  Go to a `Record page` and press `+`at the top right of the page, or go to the Task tab and press the `Add Task`button. 

## Adding Task Content

Once you've created a task you can enrich it with rich content, such as Titles, Bullet points or even images. To do so, simply press "/" and enter the desired command.

# Viewing Tasks

On the **Tasks** page, all your tasks across your workspace are displayed. Here you can:

-  Filter tasks assigned to a specific user by clicking the button with your name at the top right of the screen.
-  Switch Between `To do` and `Done`: Easily toggle between upcoming and completed tasks for a clear view of what needs attention and what has been accomplished.

You can also see tasks for a given Record on its `Record page`. 

# Editing Tasks

To edit a task, you should click on its card. This will open a side panel offering the following features:

-  **Assignee and Due date**: Update the assignee or edit the due date.
-  **Comments**: Easily collaborate with your team members by adding comments on tasks to give updates or feedback.
-  **Automations**: Thanks to our API and Webhooks, you can also automate task creation triggered by specific activities in your workspace.

# Marking Tasks as Complete

To mark a task as complete:

1. Locate the task on your `Tasks` page or within a `Record page`.
2. Click on the circle at the left of the task card - it will change to signify completion.
3. The task status will automatically update to `Done`.

This procedure will help maintain an updated record of your accomplishments. 

# Delete a task

To permanently remove a task:

1. Open the task you want to delete by clicking on its card, either from the `Tasks` page or within a `Record page`.
2. Click the trash icon located at the top right corner of the task details panel.

Please note, deleting a task is permanent and cannot be undone. Consider marking tasks as `Done` if there is a chance you will need to refer back to them.
